# --- Optional Embassy Integration ---
# esp-idf-svc = { version = "0.51", features = ["critical-section", "embassy-time-driver", "embassy-sync"] }

# If you enable embassy-time-driver, you MUST also add one of:

# a) Standalone Embassy libs ( embassy-time, embassy-sync etc) with a foreign async runtime:
# embassy-time = { version = "0.4.0", features = ["generic-queue-8"] } # NOTE: any generic-queue variant will work

# b) With embassy-executor:
# embassy-executor = { version = "0.7", features = ["executor-thread", "arch-std"] }

# NOTE: if you use embassy-time with embassy-executor you don't need the generic-queue-8 feature

# --- Temporary workaround for embassy-executor < 0.8 ---
# esp-idf-svc = { version = "0.51", features = ["embassy-time-driver", "embassy-sync"] }
# critical-section = { version = "1.1", features = ["std"], default-features = false }
